Experimental sandbox for creating Pipeline + Reach + Algorand integration

# Introduction

This is a frontend application for running a "Morra game" created by Russ Fustino. The original Reach program is included in src/ for reference. The compiled reach program and smart contract is located in build/. The frontend logic is now located in src/App.js. 

## Starting Reach Algorand devnet:

After installing reach, run the following line in reach/tut in a Linux shell:

```bash
$ REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=ALGO ./reach devnet
```

After starting the devnet, find the ip address that corresponds to your localhost (this will allow testing on different devices on the same local network).

Open src/App.js and replace the "localhost" on the following two lines with your local ip address:

```jsx
myEnv.ALGO_INDEXER_SERVER = "http://localhost";
myEnv.ALGO_SERVER = "http://localhost";
```

## Running the React App

```bash
cd pipeline-morra-reach
npm install
npm run start
```
